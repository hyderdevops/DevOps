ip adderess,subnet,cidr range,osi model

How our mobile device connect to a website like google.com over the internet, how does the traffic flow from my device to website and how this website receives req and send response back to us 
Networking fundamentals are very important to understand organization infrastrucutre or the application function
IP Address:-
ip address is used to generate a unique address to a device connected to your network 
ipv4 standard is 4 bytes 
1 byte is equal to 8 bits
example of my ip address is 192.168.135.215 
1 byte          2nd byte      3rd byte      4th byte
---------     | --------    | --------    | --------   total 32bits
2^7,2^6,2^5,2^4,2^3,2^2,2^1,2^0
128, 64, 32, 16, 8,  4,  2,   1
11000000  |  10101000   | 10000111   |  11000111
 192             168         135            215
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subnets:-
dividing a network into parts is called subnet, advantage of subnet is to get security, privacy and proper isolation.
2 subnets 1)private(dont have access to internet) 2)public (access to internet)
internet-->aws---->route tables---->igw---->acess to internet
cidr 
172.158.3.5/16 means 32-16= 16 ----> 2^16 ---->256*256=65536 this is the number of ip address of cidr

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports:-
whenever we provide ip adderess to connet to website we provide ports like :80,:443,:8080
to bind an application we use port with ipaddress, using port we can distinguish the request has to go to which application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OSI MODEL:-
http, tcp, L1-L7
different components and diff layers involves in send request and getting response over the internet--->means transfer of data 
OSI Model is one of the popular model which helps u to understand the journey of data across the internet via different layers in L7 layers to L1 layers
before we understand the journey of data, even before your browser initiates a request to the google server 2 things happens even before osi model comes into picture
1)DNS Resolution:- browser always check that the for ex:- www.google.com(8.8.8.8) is mapped to any paticular ip address, first check it in the local cache if its not available 
in the local cache the goes to the internet provider ISP for ip mapping, if this ip address is validated then moved to 2nd step tcp handshake.
2)Tcp Handshake:- If client is ready to send request and the server is also ready to accept then the handshake is done if the server denies then the handshake is not done.
its called 3 way hand shake 1)client say hi (synk) to server 2)server reply saying hi (synk ack) 3)client say ack

if dns resolution and tcp handshake is done then only data request initiation starts 

http/https://google.com
ftp://goolge.com

L7----> http/https/ftp request  ---> application layer
L6----> encryption/formatting   ---> presentation Layer
L5----> session ---->session layer which doesn't ask for authentication once after login.
L7, L6 & L5 are taken care by browser itself 
L4----> segmentation --->tcp/udp(protocol is identified here) --->transport layer
L3--- > sending data by router occurs in this stage, routers decides the path to transfer packet from sorce ip to destination ip in a shortest path --->networking layer
L2----> Data link layer, sends data in the form of frames(mac) if the data is transferd form switches not router
L1----> routers / swicthers are connected to optical cables and optical cables understand electronic signals --->physical layer

TCP/IP Model:-
L7,L6,L5 all are combined in Tcp/Ip Model as all these layers are are browser level only.

VPC:-
virtual private cloud provides a security to our resources 
devops engineer creates a vpc which has 2 subnets public and private subnets
request--->IGW(internet gateway)--->public subnet(common subnet)--->LB--->route table(router)--->NACL(NACL is Automation for SG)/Security Group(SG)--->private subnet app reached

NAT:-
If application which is in private subnet wants to download some package or something from internet its a bad practise to expose our application IP to internet 
NAT translates private IP addresses (used in local network) to a public IP address (used on the internet) and vice versa
its hide internal ip's from the outside world and enables multiple devices to connect to the internet using one ip.

vpc has two subnet 1)public 2)private in two AZ 
each public subnet has NAT gateway(to mask private subnet ip) and a LB Node.
the app or server are running in the private subnet are launched or terminated by auto scaling group and recieves request/traffic through LB 
the servers can connect to internet through NAT gateway

Auto Sacling Group:-
create my 2 replicas or more replicas of instances if i get more traffic 
for ex:- an instance or server can takes only 100 request and i get 300 request then auto scaling group can create 2 more instances to serve the request thus total 3 instances 
can servres request now and similarly it can delete instances if not required.

Load Balancer:-
balance the request depending upon the request and server configuration 
llly can do path base routing, host base routing, etc

Baston server or jump server:-
a publicly access server has an public ip 
typically placed in public subnet
used to ssh or rdp into private server indirectly
acts as jump box to prevent direct access to private subnet instances
